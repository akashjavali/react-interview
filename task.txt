// TASK: Responsive, Filterable, Sortable User Table in React (30 mins)

// Build a React component displaying a user list in a table layout.

// You may use Tailwind CSS for styling and responsiveness if you prefer.

// Requirements:
1. Fetch a list of users from the API:
    https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

2. Display user info with columns:
    - Name
    - Email
    - Company

3. Add a search input that filters users by their name (case-insensitive).

4. Implement responsive design:
    - Table should adjust for both mobile and desktop screens.
    - Tailwind CSS allowed!

5. Show a loading state while fetching data.

6. Handle API errors gracefully.

7. Add basic accessibility features:
    - Use appropriate aria-labels.
    - Ensure keyboard-friendly navigation.

8. Add clear code comments for maintainability.

9. Allow sorting users by Name (ascending/descending).

// Try to write clean, readable, and maintainable code.
// Focus on important behaviorsâ€”filter, sort, response, error, good UX.
// State all your assumptions and decisions in comments.
